**Excel Dashboard – Medical Device Dataset**
**Project Overview**

This project involved the creation of an interactive Excel dashboard to analyze and visualize data related to medical devices. The dataset included multiple attributes such as device name, manufacturer, cost, patient type, device temperature, cautions, warnings, lifetime, and weight.

The primary objective was to transform raw medical device data into actionable insights for decision-makers in healthcare and device management, enabling them to track device performance, identify trends, and make informed operational and procurement decisions.

The dashboard was designed to be intuitive, dynamic, and business-ready, allowing users to interact with the data through filters and slicers, while automatically updating key metrics and charts.

**Goals and Objectives**

**Data Analysis and Insight Generation**

Examine various aspects of medical devices, including cost, operational metrics, and usage parameters.

Highlight critical device information such as cautions, warnings, and lifetime for safety and operational planning.

Summarize insights into an easily understandable format that allows non-technical stakeholders to make decisions quickly.

**Interactive Reporting**
Enable users to filter data by device, manufacturer, or patient type.

Provide dynamic charts that automatically update as filters are applied.

Ensure real-time calculation of key metrics using Excel formulas and Pivot Tables.

**Operational Decision Support**

Assist medical procurement and device management teams in understanding trends in device usage, costs, and operational risks.

Highlight devices with extreme or critical values for temperature, warnings, or lifetime.

**Dataset Description**

The project leveraged a comprehensive dataset sourced from Kaggle, covering various medical devices and their specifications. Key attributes include:

**Device Name** – Unique identifier for each device

**Manufacturer** – Company producing the device

**Cost** – Price of the device in respective currency

**Patient Type** – Type of patients the device is intended for

**Device Temperature** – Operational or storage temperature of the device

**Cautions & Warnings** – Important safety and usage instructions

**Lifetime** – Expected operational lifespan

**Weight** – Physical weight of the device

This structured dataset allowed for the creation of multi-dimensional analyses across cost, operational performance, and safety metrics.

**Tools and Techniques**

The project was developed entirely in Microsoft Excel, leveraging its powerful data analysis and visualization capabilities. Key tools and techniques used include:

**Pivot Tables:** To summarize and aggregate data efficiently, enabling drill-down insights.

**Dynamic Charts:** Pie charts, Donut charts, Clustered Bar charts, and others linked to Pivot Tables for live updates.

**Slicers:** Interactive filters for device-level selection and cross-visual updates.

**Formulas & GETPIVOTDATA:** To automate calculations and generate live metrics dynamically.

**Conditional Formatting:** To highlight key metrics, warnings, or outliers for immediate attention.

**Interactive Text Boxes:** Linked to Pivot Table data to display metrics that update with slicer selections.

These features together made the dashboard dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly for business and operational use.

**Dashboard Features**

**Multiple Pivot Tables**
Provide granular insight into cost, device temperature, lifetime, and other critical parameters.

Allow aggregation by manufacturer, patient type, or device category.

**Dynamic Charts**

Visualize key metrics and trends over time or by category.

Include Pie, Donut, and Clustered Bar charts that are responsive to slicers.

**Slicer Integration**

Enable users to filter by device, manufacturer, or other attributes.

Automatically updates all linked visuals for real-time analysis.

**Live Metrics**

Key figures displayed using GETPIVOTDATA and linked text boxes.

Metrics dynamically adjust as slicers are changed, providing instant insight.

**Key Insights**

Identified high-cost devices and analyzed their distribution across manufacturers and patient types.

Tracked device lifetime and highlighted devices approaching end-of-life for replacement planning.

Evaluated temperature and warnings to flag devices requiring special handling or monitoring.

Enabled comparison of multiple metrics side by side to support cross-functional decision-making.

This allowed stakeholders to make data-driven decisions for operational planning, procurement strategies, and risk mitigation.

**Impact and Value**

The Excel dashboard significantly improved data transparency and decision-making efficiency for medical device management:

**Operational Efficiency:** Rapid access to key metrics reduced manual data processing time.

**Decision Support:** Enabled procurement teams to identify trends and plan device replacements or purchases strategically.

**Risk Management:** Highlighted devices with critical warnings, temperature concerns, or reduced lifetime.

**Business-Ready Reporting:** Interactive visuals allowed stakeholders to explore data without needing technical expertise.

**Reflections and Learning**

This project strengthened skills in:

Advanced Excel analytics including Pivot Tables, formulas, and GETPIVOTDATA

Creating interactive and dynamic dashboards suitable for business use

Effective data storytelling through charts, metrics, and layout design

Handling complex datasets and transforming them into actionable insights

The project also emphasized the importance of user-friendly design in Excel dashboards, ensuring that technical data could be interpreted and acted upon easily by non-technical users.

**Future Enhancements**

Potential improvements for this dashboard include:

Integration with Power Query for automatic data refresh from external sources

Incorporation of trend analysis over time with historical data

Conditional alerts for devices reaching critical thresholds

Conversion into a Power BI dashboard for enhanced visualization and interactivity
